6. ### Interview Experience (share the questions asked in the interview/expectation of the panel)

> {{< collapse summary="Expand" >}}

First round had one simple logic puzzle and a medium dsa questions(max water stored). He also asked a few questions about python and c++ language itself. Second round was mostly focused on financial knowledge. You need to know basic financial literature as they expect everyone to be aware of the same in the firm(MnC has 5 finance courses so he dug deeper into the subject). Last round was with the Director and he grilled for 1.5 hours with questions ranging from hardcore OOPs(eg: implementation of virtual functions in memory, only the knowhow), C++ and system design questions. He mainly wanted to judge the problem solving abilities other than the DSA domain. Must prepare system design and OOPs really well and be confident in answering. Also asked a few HR questions towards the end.
