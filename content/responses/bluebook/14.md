First round was DSA round and he asked one digit DP question. Very calm interviewer. Explained brute force then optimized approach and derived the time complexity. Do not force your solution on the interviewer, try to walk him through your approach and prove that your solution is correct(either by taking cornercases or mathematically). Then second round was with Director and HR. Director was very humble and mainly asked questions from CV(experience and projects). Be thorough with the technologies you have put on your CV and why did you choose it. Prepare standard HR questions involving leadership, team management, decision making and problem solving skills. Overall - Really good interview(had to reject the offer).
